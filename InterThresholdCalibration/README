Aim
---
This is an example of analysis, producing J-PET interthreshold time calibration using data taken in dedicated measurement, in which one threshold of chosen PMT was distinguished and three others were set to match their counts with the chosen one.


Input Data
-----------
For this example, user must provide data file(s) collected with the collimator at position z=0 in measurement dedicated to interthreshold calibration.

Expected output
---------------
No output to stdout.
JPet.log file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following extensions are produced:
 *.tslot.calib.root
 *.raw.sig.root
 *.phys.sig.root
 *.hits.root
 *.hits.calib.root
where "*" stands for the name of the input file.

Moreover, a text file "TimeConstantsInterThrCalib.txt" is created in the working directory, which contains time calibration information.

Description
--------------
The analysis is using the same set of tasks as the "LargeBarrelAnalysis" example up to the level of creation of hits (included). On top of these tasks, an additional module called "InterThresholdCalibration" is run, which prepares spectra of time differences between signals on threshold "a" (lowest) and other thresholds, separately on side A and B of each scintillator. 

Additional info
--------------
For description of possible parameters, that can be used in useParams.json,
see file PARAMETERS. Take time callibration with TDC correction for dedicated RUN!

Compiling 
------------
make

Running
------------
The script run.sh contains an example of running the analysis. Note, however, that
the user must fill the input data file name and the number of run
